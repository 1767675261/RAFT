## Experiment: Impact of LLM Capability on Test Case Generation

This experiment explore the effect of capability of LLMs on test case generation of RAFT. We compare the test case generation results of RAFT using different LLMs, parameter counting from 2B to 1000B.

Note: This experiment are not shown in paper due to the space limitation.
