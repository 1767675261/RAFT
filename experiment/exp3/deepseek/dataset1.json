A motorist must always obey the speed limit. Speed affects almost everything that can happen when driving. A good rule is to keep up with the flow of traffic at any legal speed. To make safe emergency stops when necessary, it is important to keep enough distance from surrounding traffic. New Jersey law sets top speed limits for any given road, street, highway, or freeway.\nSPEED LIMIT 25 mph: School zones, business, or residential districts\nSPEED LIMIT 35 mph: Suburban business and residential districts\nSPEED LIMIT 50 mph: Non-posted rural roadways\nSPEED LIMIT 55 mph: Certain state highways (as posted) and interstates\nSPEED LIMIT 65 mph: Certain interstate highways (as posted)\nMotorists pay double fines for exceeding the 65 mph limit by 10 miles per hour or more. Double fines also apply to most other moving violations committed in a 65 mph zone. (N.J.S.A. 39:4-98.6)",

Pedestrians and motorists must all do their part to keep pedestrians safe.\nA motorist must:\n• Stop for pedestrians in crosswalks. Failure to stop carries a fine of up to $500, up to 25 days in jail, community service, a driving privilege suspension of up to 6 months, and 2 points. (N.J.S.A. 39:4-36)\n• Watch for pedestrians when turning on red.\n• Obey speed limits.\n• Be sure not to block or park in crosswalks.\n• Keep the vehicle’s windshield clean for maximum visibility.\n• Always be alert for pedestrians.\n• Be aware of areas where pedestrians are most likely to appear (near schools, town centers, residential neighborhoods, parks).\n• Never pass another vehicle that has stopped for a pedestrian.\n• Stop for all pedestrians in a crosswalk even if they began crossing with a proper signal and they are still in the crosswalk when the signal changes.\n• Remember that pedestrians are the most vulnerable roadway users.\nMotorists will be held responsible for maintaining pedestrian safety.",

If a lane change is impossible, prohibited by law or unsafe, the motorist must reduce the speed of his/her vehicle to a reasonable and proper speed that is lower than the posted speed limit and be prepared to stop, if necessary. Motorists who violate this law face a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500.

In order to make the traffic stop as safe and pleasant as possible for all involved, here are some important tips:\n• Pull over in a safe place as soon as possible.\n• Be courteous, mutual respect between the officer and the driver is expected and encouraged.\n• Have your license, insurance card and registration in a place you can easily access.\n• Turn down your music.\n• If you are stopped at night, turn on your dome and/or interior lights. This will increase the visibility inside your vehicle so the Officer will be less concerned about what he or she cannot see.\n• Roll down your window.\n• Keep your hands visible, preferably on the steering wheel.\n• Do not make sudden movements, particularly if the movements involve reaching into areas not visible to the Officer. If you must reach for something, wait for the Officer to come to your vehicle and tell the Officer what you are planning to do before you do it.\n• Stay calm and communicate with the Officer.",

The bright beam is for open country driving when there is no traffic in sight. The bright beam helps a motorist see farther ahead and peripherally or at a wider angle. At night, a motorist’s pupils are dilated, allowing more light to aid in the ability to see. Bright beams can momentarily blind other motorists by constricting the pupils and should not be used if other vehicles are approaching or when driving behind another vehicle. It can take three to five seconds for a motorist to recover from the glare of approaching high-beam headlights. At a speed of 50 mph, a motorist will have traveled the length of a football field while being unable to see. If a vehicle is approaching with high beams, a motorist should look to the right of the road until the vehicle passes. Never flash high beams at an approaching motorist.\nThe dim beams are used for city driving and driving in traffic on roadways. Dim beams are focused down on the road. Dim beams are used when traveling behind other vehicles or when another vehicle is approaching.",

They become brighter when a motorist applies the brakes to show that he/she is slowing or stopping. During the day, without headlights, the taillights also turn on as a motorist applies the brakes.\n• Brake lights: Brake lights become brighter when a motorist applies the brakes, showing that the vehicle is slowing or stopping.\n• Interim (overhead) lights: Found inside the vehicle, these types of lights should be used only briefly (when necessary) when driving or to comply with a police officer’s request to illuminate the motorist’s compartment of the vehicle when stopped.\n• Dashboard lights: If dashboard lights are too bright, they may create a glare for the motorist and impede vision. The lights should be kept dim but still light enough for a motorist to read the dials.\n• Spotlights: Spotlights should be used only in emergencies. This also applies to emergency flashers (hazard lights). Spotlights may not be used for driving purposes.\n• Fog lights: These auxiliary driving lights may be used with low-beam headlights to provide general lighting ahead of a motor vehicle, specifically during foggy weather conditions.

Motorists are permitted to use a hands-free cellular telephone if it does not interfere with any federally required safety equipment or with the safe operation of the vehicle. Although the use of a hands-free cellular telephone is legal, it is strongly discouraged.",
