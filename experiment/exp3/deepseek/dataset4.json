        "rule": "4.1 General: This clause defines the requirements on generating plants to be operated in parallel with the distribution network. Where settings or a range of configurability is provided and respecting the legal framework the configurations and settings may be provided by the DSO. Where no settings are provided by the DSO, the specified default settings shall be used; if no default settings are provided, the producer shall propose settings and inform the DSO. The requirements of Clause 4 apply during normal operation of the generating units and do not apply in case of maintenance or units out of operation. The provisions apply to EESS in generation mode. In charging mode EESS should have the same characteristics, unless stated otherwise in the clauses of this European Standard. The applicability is independent of the duration the generating unit operates in parallel with the distribution network. It is the responsibility of the DSO to relax, if deemed appropriate, the requirements for an individual generating unit or plant whose operation in parallel only lasts for a short time (temporary operation in parallel). The relaxed requirements shall be agreed between the DSO and the producer, along with the maximum allowable duration of the temporary operation in parallel. For the short-term parallel operation an appropriate device shall automatically disconnect the generating unit or plant as soon as the maximum allowable duration has elapsed. If different requirements on the generating plant interfere with each other, the following hierarchy in descending order shall be applied: 1. Generating unit protection, including regarding the prime mover; 2. Interface protection (see 4.9) and protection against faults within the generating plant; 3. Voltage support during faults and voltage steps (see 4.7.4); 4. The lower value of: remote control command on active power limitation for distribution grid security (see 4.11) and local response to overfrequency (see 4.6.1); 5. Local response to underfrequency if applicable (see 4.6.2); 6. Reactive power (see 4.7.2) and active power (P(U) see 4.7.2) controls; 7. Other control commands on active power set point for e.g. market, economic reasons, self-consumption optimization. The system shall be so designed that under foreseeable conditions no self-protection trips prior to the fulfilment of the requirements of this European Standard and all settings provided by the DSO or responsible party. For cogeneration plants embedded in industrial sites, active power requirements shall be agreed between the responsible party and the producer. In such a case the priority list is adapted accordingly. Besides the requirements of Clause 4, additional requirements apply for connecting a generating plant to the distribution network, e.g. assessment of the point of connection. However, this is excluded from the scope of this European Standard but some guidance is provided in the informative Annex A. EN 50549-10 provides technical guidance for tests on generating units and interface protection to evaluate their electrical characteristics. EN 50549-10 shall be applied to evaluate the characteristics of generating units and interface protection used in generating plants relating to the requirements of this Standard. Electrical characteristics may alternatively be evaluated according to standards other than EN 50549-10, if the following prerequisites are fulfilled: - The alternative verification procedure covers all required technical aspects and characteristic quantities stipulated in EN 50549-1 and EN 50549-2, respectively. - The alternative verification procedure shall not be less stringent or technically less demanding than the correspondent verification procedure in EN 50549-10. - The alternative verification procedure leads to results of at least equivalent confidence level as EN 50549-10. - The equivalent or higher confidence level of the alternative verification procedure shall be confirmed by the entity stating compliance based upon these tests. - The entity stating compliance based upon these tests shall have sufficient expertise in both EN 50549-10 and the applied standard. NOTE: This also applies for a partial application of another standard only for specific functions or operational capabilities.",

In the frequency range from 47 Hz to 52 Hz the generating plant should be capable of operating until the interface protection trips. Therefore, the generating plant shall at least be capable of operating in the frequency ranges, for the duration and for the minimum requirement as indicated in Table 1. Respecting the legal framework, it is possible that for some synchronous areas more stringent time periods and/or frequency ranges will be required by the DSO and the responsible party. Nevertheless, they are expected to be within the boundaries of the stringent requirement as indicated in Table 1 unless producer, DSO, TSO and responsible party agree on wider frequency ranges and longer durations. NOTE 1: For small isolated distribution networks (typically on islands) even more stringent time periods and frequency ranges may be required. As long as generating modules with linear Sterling engines are recognized as emerging technology according to COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2016/631 Title 6, they are permitted to disconnect below 49,5 Hz and above 50,5 Hz. This permission does not affect the requirements for interface protection according to clause 4.9. In this case over and under frequency machine protection might trip prior to interface protection. If an integrated interface protection device is used, the reduction of the configuration range of the interface protection in clause 4.9 is acceptable. NOTE 2: The status of emerging technology in COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2016/631 Title 6 depends on the cumulative maximum capacity of this technology.

In case of pre-fault voltages below nominal voltage and a voltage step of more than 25 % Un disconnection is allowed.

Exempted from this requirement are small generating units below 50 kW of the following generation technologies: CHP, fuel cell, rotating machinery, hydro. NOTE 1: Exemption is acceptable for CHP, fuel cell, and generating units based on rotating machinery below 50 kW as EN 50465 for gas appliance requests disconnection in case of over voltage. NOTE 2: This is a minimum requirement. Further power system stability aspects might be relevant. The technical discussion is still ongoing. A voltage jump of +10 % of Uc from any stable point of operation is considered. In case of steady-state voltages near the maximum voltage before the event, this will result in an over voltage situation for many seconds.

    {
        "rule": "4.6.1 Power response to overfrequency: Generating plants shall be capable of activating active power response to overfrequency at a programmable frequency threshold f1 at least between and including 50,2 Hz and 52 Hz with a programmable droop in a range of at least s=2 % to s=12 %. The droop reference is Pref. Unless defined differently by the responsible party: Pref=Pmax, in the case of synchronous generating technology and electrical energy storage systems. Pref=PM, the actual AC output power at the instant when the frequency reaches the threshold f1, in the case of all other non-synchronous generating technology. The power value calculated according to the droop is a maximum power limit. If e.g. the available primary power decreases during a high frequency period below the power defined by the droop function, lower power values are permitted. With ΔP=(1/s)·((f1-f)/fn)·Pref, where f is the actual frequency, the maximum power limit is: Pmax-limit=PM+ΔP. NOTE 1: In other documents power response to overfrequency can also be described as frequency control or Limited Frequency Sensitive Mode - Overfrequency (LFSM-O). NOTE 2: The active power droop relative to the reference power might also be defined as an active power gradient relative to the reference power. A droop in the range of 2 % to 12 % represents a gradient of 100 % to 16,7 % Pref /Hz so with g defined by g[P/Pref / Hz]=(1/(s·fn)) we get ΔP=g·Pref·(f1-f). The generating plant shall be capable of activating active power response to overfrequency as fast as technically feasible with an intrinsic dead time that shall be as short as possible with a maximum of 2 s. An intentional delay shall be programmable to adjust the dead time to a value between the intrinsic dead time and 2 s. The response time shall be as fast as technically feasible. EXAMPLE: - The following response times are considered technically feasible for specific generating technologies. - For PV and battery inverters below 1 s for ΔP of 100 % Pmax. - For wind turbines 2 s for ΔP<50 % Pmax. - For combustion engines, gas turbines, fuel cells below 2 MW 66 % /min for a 100 % change. - For combustion engines, gas turbines, fuel cells above 2 MW 20 % /min for a 100 % change. After activation, the active power frequency response shall use the actual frequency at any time, reacting to any frequency increase or decrease according to the programmed droop with an accuracy of ± 10 % of the nominal power (see Figure 9). The resolution of the frequency measurement shall be ± 10 mHz or less. The accuracy is evaluated with a 1 min average value. At POC, loads if present in the producer’s network might interfere with the response of the generating plant. The effect of loads is not considered for the evaluation of the accuracy, only the behaviour of the generating plant is relevant. NOTE 4: With the provision above, the intentional delay is only active for the activation of the function, once the function is operating, the established control loop is not intentionally delayed. NOTE 5: The option of an intentional delay is required since a very fast and undelayed active power frequency response in case of loss of mains would correct any excess of generation leading to a generation-consumption balance. In these circumstances, an unintended islanding situation with stable frequency would take place, in which the correct behaviour of any loss of mains detection based on frequency might be hindered. NOTE 6: The intentional delay is considered relevant for power system stability. For that reason, legal regulations might require a mutual agreement on the setting between DSO, responsible party and TSO. Generating plants reaching their minimum regulating level shall, in the event of further frequency increase, maintain this power level constant unless the DSO and the responsible party requires to disconnect the complete plant or if the plant consists of multiple units by disconnecting individual units. The active power frequency response is only deactivated if the frequency falls below the frequency threshold f1. If required by the DSO and the responsible party an additional deactivation threshold frequency fstop shall be programmable in the range of at least 50 Hz to f1. If fstop is configured to a frequency below f1 there shall be no response according to the droop in case of a frequency decrease (see Figure 10). The output power is kept constant until the frequency falls below fstop for a configurable time tstop. If at the time of deactivation of the active power frequency response the momentary active power PM is below the available active power PA, the active power increase of the generating plant shall not exceed the gradient defined in 4.10.2. Settings for the threshold frequency f1, the droop and the intentional delay are provided by the DSO and the responsible party. If no settings are provided, the default settings in Table 2 should be applied. NOTE 7: When applying active power response to overfrequency, the frequency threshold f1 should be set to a value from 50,2 Hz up to 50,5 Hz. Setting the frequency threshold f1 to 52 Hz is considered as deactivating this function.",

NOTE 8: PV generating units are considered to have the ability to reduce power over the full droop range. NOTE 9: Protection setting overrules this behaviour. Alternatively for the droop function described above, the following procedure is allowed for generating modules if permitted by the DSO and the responsible party: the generating units shall disconnect at randomized frequencies, ideally uniformly distributed between the frequency threshold f1 and 52 Hz; NOTE 10: The usage of a disconnection limit above 51,5Hz does not necessarily imply the requirement to operate at this frequency. Operating range is defined in clause 4.4.4. If the randomized disconnection value is above the operating range and interface protection setting, the unit is disconnected according to chapter 4.9 at the value set by the interface protection. in case the frequency decreases again, the generating unit shall start its reconnection procedure once the frequency falls below the specific frequency that initiated the disconnection; for this procedure, the connection conditions described in 4.10 do not apply; the randomization shall either be at unit level by changing the threshold over time, or on plant level by choosing different values for each unit within a plant, or on distribution system level if the DSO specifies a specific threshold for each plant or unit connected to its distribution system. NOTE 11: This procedure could be applied for generating modules for which it is technically not feasible to reduce power with the required accuracy in the required time or for reasons within the distribution network for example to prevent unintentional island operation. NOTE 12: The behaviour will, for a part of the network with many such units, result in a similar droop as specified above for controllable generating units and hence will provide for the necessary power system stability. Due to its fast reaction capability it contributes significantly to the avoidance of a frequency overshoot. EES units upon reaching zero power output shall continue to follow the configured droop by switching into charging mode. EES units that are in charging mode shall increase the charging power according to the configured droop. In both cases, the minimum regulating level is considered as the maximum charging power taking the state of charge of the storage into account. In case the maximum charging capacity is reached or to prevent any other risk of injury or damage of equipment, a reduction of charging power is permitted. NOTE 13: In this context charging is regarded as a point of operation with negative active power output. If required by the DSO and the responsible party a mode shall be available where an EES upon reaching zero power will remain at zero power and will not switch into charging mode and an EES unit that is in charging mode shall keep the charging power constant. DC coupled storage integrated into the DC side of a generating unit are exempted from this requirement, if they are not capable of charging from AC. These exempted units upon reaching zero power shall remain at zero power and shall not switch into charging mode.",

        "rule": "4.6.2 Power response to underfrequency: EES units shall be capable of activating active power response to underfrequency. Other generating units/plants should be capable of activating active power response to underfrequency. If active power to underfrequency is provided by a generating plant/unit, the function shall comply with the requirements below. NOTE 1: In other documents power response to underfrequency is also described as frequency control or Limited Frequency Sensitive Mode - Underfrequency (LFSM-U). Active power response to underfrequency shall be provided when all of the following conditions are met: when generating, the generating unit is operating at active power below its maximum active power Pmax; when generating, the generating unit is operating at active power below the available active power PA; NOTE 2: In case of EES units, the available power includes the state of charge of the storage. the voltages at the point of connection of the generating plant are within the continuous operating voltage range; and when generating, the generating unit is operating with currents lower than its current limit. NOTE 3: These conditions apply to each generating unit individually since the specified conditions need to be met by each generating unit individually to allow the unit to increase power. In the case of EES units, active power frequency response to underfrequency shall be provided in charging and generating mode. NOTE 4: In the case of EES units, the charging is regarded as a point of operation with negative active power. In charging mode the active power consumption is reduced according to the configured droop. Depending on the depth of the underfrequency event a change to generating mode will happen. In this case the state of charge of the storage is part of the conditions above. NOTE 5: This clause provides additional detail to the network code on emergency and restoration (Regulation (EU) 2017/2196) and more precisely on its Article 15 3 (a). The active power response to underfrequency shall be delivered at a programmable frequency threshold f1 at least between and including 49,8 Hz and 46,0 Hz with a programmable droop in a range of at least 2 % to 12 %. The droop reference Pref is Pmax. If the available primary power or a local set value increases during an underfrequency period above the power defined by the droop function, higher power values are permitted. The power value calculated according to the droop is therefore a minimum limit. The minimum power limit is, Pmin-limit=PM+ΔP, with ΔP=(1/s)×((f1-f)/fn)×Pref where f is the actual frequency. NOTE 6: In the case of active power response to underfrequency, Pmax is used as Pref to allow for system support even in case of low power output in the moment the event begins. NOTE 7: The active power droop relative to the reference power might also be defined as an active power gradient relative to the reference power. A droop in the range of 2 % to 12 % represents a gradient of 100 % to 16,7 % Pref /Hz so with g defined by g[P/Pref / Hz]=(1/(s·fn)) we get ΔP=g·Pref·(f1-f). NOTE 8: In the case of an increase of active power generation, the hierarchy of requirements in clause 4.1 apply. The generating unit shall be capable of activating active power response to underfrequency as fast as technically feasible with an intrinsic dead time that shall be as short as possible with a maximum of 2 s and with a step response time of maximum 30 s unless another value is defined by the relevant party. An intentional initial delay shall be programmable to adjust the dead time to a value between the intrinsic dead time and 2 s. After activation, the active power frequency response shall use the actual frequency at any time, reacting to any frequency increase or decrease according to the programmed droop with an accuracy of ± 10 % of the nominal power. The accuracy is evaluated with a 1 min average value. The resolution of the frequency measurement shall be ± 10 mHz or less. At POC loads, if present in the producer’s network, might interfere with the response of the generating plant. The effect of loads is not considered for the evaluation of the accuracy, only the behaviour of the generating plant is relevant. NOTE 9: With the provision above, the intentional delay is only active for the activation of the function, once the function is operating, the established control loop is not intentionally delayed. NOTE 10: The option of an intentional delay is required since a very fast and undelayed active power frequency response in case of loss of mains would correct any shortage of generation leading to a generation-consumption balance. In these circumstances, an unintended islanding situation with stable frequency would take place, in which the correct behaviour of any loss of mains detection based on frequency might be hindered. NOTE 11: The intentional delay is considered relevant for power system stability. For that reason, legal regulations might require a mutual agreement on the setting between DSO, responsible party and TSO. Generating modules reaching any of the conditions above during the provision of active power frequency response shall, in the event of further frequency decrease, maintain this power level constant. The active power frequency response is only deactivated if the frequency increases above the frequency threshold f1. Settings for the threshold frequency f1, the droop and the intentional delay are defined by the DSO and the responsible party, if no settings are provided, the function shall be disabled. NOTE 12: When applying active power response to underfrequency, the frequency threshold f1 should be set to a value from 49,8 Hz up to 49,5 Hz. Setting the frequency threshold f1 to 46 Hz is considered as deactivating this function. The activation and deactivation of the function and its settings shall be field adjustable and means shall be provided to protect these from unpermitted interference (e.g. password or seal) if required by the DSO and the responsible party.",

Unless specified differently below, for specific generating technologies, generating plants shall be able to operate with active factors as defined by the DSO and the responsible party from active factor=0,90 underexcited to active factor=0,90 overexcited. The reactive power capability shall be evaluated at the terminals of the/each generating unit. CHP generating units with a capacity ≤150 kVA shall be able to operate with active factors as defined by the DSO from cos φ=0,95 underexcited to cos φ=0,95 overexcited. Generating units with an induction generator coupled directly to the grid and used in generating plants above micro generating level, shall be able to operate with active factors as defined by the DSO from cos φ=0,95 underexcited to cos φ=1 at the terminals of the unit. Deviating from 4.7.2.3 only the cos φ set point mode is required. Deviating from the accuracy requirements below, the accuracy is only required at active power PD. Generating units with an induction generator coupled directly to the grid and used in micro generating plants shall operate with an active factor above 0,95 at the terminals of the generating unit. A controlled voltage support by reactive power is not required from this technology. Generating units with linear generators, coupled directly and synchronously to the grid shall operate with an active factor above 0,95 at the terminals of the generating unit, and therefore a controlled voltage support by reactive power is not required from this technology. In case of different generating technologies with different requirements in one generating plant, each unit shall provide voltage support by reactive power as required for its specific technology. A compensation of one technology to reach the general plant requirement is not expected. The DSO and the responsible party may relax the above requirements. This relaxation might be general or specific for a certain generating plant or generating technology. NOTE 1: The generating unit manufacturer has a certain freedom in the sizing of the output side of the generating unit in order to respond to the requirements of this document (e.g. due to voltage changes or reactive power exchange). This is indicated by the Design freedom area in Figure 12. On request, the manufacturer shall provide to all involved parties information documenting the actual choices regarding active power capabilities relative to reactive power requirements and related to the power rating in the operating voltage range (see further in this clause). A P-Q Diagram shall be included in the product documentation of a generating unit. NOTE 2: For additional network support an optional extended reactive power capability according to Figure 12 might be provided by the generating plant, if agreed on between the DSO and the producer and is generally required in some countries for some technologies by legal regulations. NOTE 3: Additional requirements (e.g. continuous Var compensation or continuous reactive power operation disregarding the availability of the primary energy) might be provided by the generating plant, if agreed between the DSO and the producer. NOTE 4: In case of overvoltage, additional reactive power might be exchanged up to the rated current (increasing the apparent power as a consequence), if agreed on between the DSO and the producer. When operating above the apparent power threshold Smin equal to 10 % of the maximum apparent power Smax or the minimum regulating level of the generating plant, whichever is the higher value, the reactive power capability shall be provided with an accuracy of ± 2 % Smax. Up to this apparent power threshold Smin, deviations above 2 % are permissible; nevertheless the accuracy shall always be as good as technically feasible and the exchange of uncontrolled reactive power in this low-power operation mode shall not exceed 10 % of the maximum apparent power Smax. At POC loads, if present in the producer’s network might interfere with the response of the generating plant. The effect of loads is not considered for the evaluation of the accuracy, only the behaviour of the generating plant is relevant. For generating units with a reactive power capability according Figure 12 the reactive power capability at active power PD shall be at least according Figure 13. For generating units with a reduced reactive power capability Figure 13 is only applicable up to the maximum reactive power capability. For voltages below Un it is allowed to reduce apparent power according to 4.4.4. NOTE 6: Whether there is a priority given to P or Q or the active factor when reaching the maximum apparent power this is not defined in this European Standard. Risks and benefits of different priority approaches are under consideration.",

EMC limits and tests, described in EN 61000 series, have been traditionally developed for loads, without taking into account the particularities of generating units, such as their capability to create overvoltages or high frequency disturbances due to the presence of power converters, which were either impossible or less frequent in case of loads. NOTE 1: Currently, IEC SC 77A are reviewing all their existing standards to include, where necessary, specific requirements for generating units/plants. For dispersed generating units in LV networks, the Technical Report IEC/TR 61000–3-15 is addressing gaps in the existing EMC standards making recommendations on the following aspects: Harmonic emissions; Flicker and voltage fluctuations; DC injection; Short and long duration overvoltages emission; Switching frequency emission; Immunity to voltage dips and short interruptions; Immunity to frequency variation; Immunity to harmonics and inter-harmonics; Unbalance. As long as specific tests for generating units are not available for immunity and/or emission, generic EMC standards and/or any relevant EU harmonized EMC standard should be applied. NOTE 2: Besides the compliance with EN61000 Series, in most countries power quality characteristic according to standards such as for example EN 61400–21 or VDE V 0124–100 are required as part of the connection agreement. Additional phenomena need to be addressed specifically to generating plants and their integration in the power system. ROCOF: See 4.5.2; UVRT: See 4.5.3; OVRT: See 4.5.4; DC injection: Generating plants shall not inject direct currents. NOTE 3: The DC injection clause is considered to be passed when for all generating units within the generating plant the measured DC injection of a type-tested unit is below the testing threshold. Generating plants can also disturb mains signalling (ripple control or power line carrier systems). EMC requirements on inter-harmonics and on conducted disturbances in the frequency range between 2 kHz and 150 kHz are under development. In case of electromagnetic interferences to mains signalling systems due to the connection of a generating plant, mitigation measures should be taken and national requirements may apply. Generating units are also expected to be compatible with voltage characteristics at the point of connection, as described in EN 50160 or in national regulations; however no compliance test is required due to the scope of EN 50160.",

        "rule": "4.9.1 General: According to HD 60364-5-551:2010, 551.7.4, means of automatic switching shall be provided to disconnect the generating plant from the distribution network in the event of loss of that supply or deviation of the voltage or frequency at the supply terminals from values declared for normal supply. This automatic means of disconnection has following main objectives: prevent the power production of the generating plant to cause an overvoltage situation in the distribution network it is connected to. Such overvoltages could result in damages to the equipment connected to the distribution network as well as the distribution network itself; detect unintentional island situations and disconnect the generating plant in this case. This is contributing to prevent damage to other equipment, both in the producers’ installations and the distribution network due to out of phase re-closing and to allow for maintenance work after an intentional disconnection of a section of the distribution network; NOTE 1: It is pointed out that checking the absence of voltage on all the live conductors is anyway mandatory before accessing a site for (maintenance) work. assist in bringing the distribution network to a controlled state in case of voltage or frequency deviations beyond corresponding regulation values. It is not the purpose of the interface protection system to: disconnect the generating plant from the distribution network in case of faults internal to the power generating plant. Protection against internal faults (short-circuits) shall be coordinated with network protection, according to DSO protection criteria. Protection against e.g. overload, electric shock and against fire hazards shall be implemented additionally according to HD 60364-1 and local requirements; prevent damages to the generating unit due to incidents (e.g. short circuits) on the distribution network. Interface protections may contribute to preventing damage to the generating units due to out-of-phase reclosing of automatic reclosing which may happen after some hundreds of ms. However, in some countries some technologies of generating units are explicitly required to have an appropriate immunity level against the consequences of out-of-phase reclosing. The type of protection and the sensitivity and operating times depend upon the protection and the characteristics of the distribution network. A wide variety of approaches to achieve the above mentioned objectives is used throughout Europe. Besides the passive observation of voltage and frequency other active and passive methods are available and used to detect island situations. The requirements given in this clause are intended to provide the necessary functions for all known approaches as well as to give guidance in their use. Which functions are available in a product shall be stated in the product documentation. The interface protection system shall comply with the requirements of this European Standard, the available functions and configured settings shall comply with the requirements of the DSO and the responsible party. In any case, the settings defined shall be understood as the values for the interface protection system, i.e. where there is a wider technical capability of the generation module, it shall not be withheld by the settings of the protections (other than the interface protection). For micro generating plants, the interface protection system and the point of measurement might be integrated into the generating units. For generating plants with nominal current above 16 A the DSO may define a threshold above which the interface protection system shall be realized as a dedicated device and not integrated into the generating units. NOTE 2: Example thresholds are 11,08 kW per generating plant (Italy), 30 kVA per generating plant (Germany, Austria) and 50 kW per generating unit (GB). NOTE 3: Integrated interface protection systems might not be possible for two different reasons: to place the protection system as close to the point of connection as possible, to avoid tripping due to overvoltages resulting from the voltage rise within the producer’s network; to allow for periodic field tests. In some countries periodic field tests are not required if the protection system meets the requirements of single fault safety. The interface protection relay acts on the interface switch. The DSO may require that the interface protection relay acts additionally on another switch with a proper delay in case the interface switch fails to operate. In case of failure of the power supply of the interface protection, the interface protection shall trigger the interface switch without delay. An uninterruptible power supply may be required by the DSO, for instance in case of UVRT capability, delay in protection etc. In case of field adjustable settings of threshold and operation time, means shall be provided to protect the settings from unpermitted interference (e.g. password or seal) if required by the DSO.",

The output of each evaluation shall be OR connected, so that if one signal passes the threshold of a function, the function shall trip the protection in the specified time. The minimum required accuracy for protection is: • for frequency measurement ± 0,05 Hz; • for voltage measurement ± 1 % of Un; The reset time shall be ≤50 ms. The interface protection relay shall not conduct continuous starting and disengaging operations of the interface protection relay. Therefore a reasonable reset ratio shall be implemented which shall not be zero but be below 2% of nominal value for voltage and below 0,2Hz for frequency. NOTE 3: If the interface protection system is external to the generating unit, it is preferably located as close as possible to the point of connection. The voltage rise between the point of connection and the measurement input of the interface protection system is then kept as small as possible to avoid nuisance tripping of the overvoltage protection.",

This information exchange is aimed at allowing the DSO and/or the TSO to improve, optimize and make safer the operation of their respective networks. The remote monitoring and operation parameter settings system that may be used by the DSO is not aimed at replacing the manual and automatic control means implemented by the generating plant operator to control the operation of the generating plant. It should not interact directly with the power generation equipment and the switching devices of the generating plant. It should interact with the operation and control system of the generating plant. In principle, standardized communication should be used. It is recommended that in case of using protocols for signal transmission used between the DSO or TSO control centre or control centres and the generating plant, relevant technical standards (e.g. EN 60870-5-101, EN 60870-5-104, EN 61850 and in particular EN 61850-7-4, EN 61850-7-420, IEC/TR 61850-90-7, as well as EN 61400-25 for wind turbines and relevant parts of IEC 62351 for relevant security measures) are recognized. Alternative protocols can be agreed between the DSO and the producer. These protocols include hardwired digital input/output and analogue input/output provided locally by DSO. The information needed for remote monitoring and the setting of configurable parameters are specific to each distribution network and to the way it is operated.

        "rule": "4.13 Requirements regarding single fault tolerance of interface protection system and interface switch: If required in 4.3.2, the interface protection system and the interface switch shall meet the requirements of single fault tolerance. A single fault shall not lead to a loss of the safety functions. Faults of common cause shall be taken into account if the probability for the occurrence of such a fault is significant. Whenever reasonably practical, the individual fault shall be displayed and lead to the disconnection of the power generating unit or system. NOTE: This requirement for the detection of individual faults does not mean that all faults are detected. Accumulation of undetected faults can therefore lead to an unintentional output signal and result in a hazardous condition. Series-connected switches shall each have a independent breaking capacity corresponding to the rated current of the generating unit and corresponding to the short circuit contribution of the generating unit. The short-time withstand current of the switching devices shall be coordinated with maximum short circuit power at the connection point. At least one of the switches shall be a switch-disconnector suitable for overvoltage category 2. For single-phase generating units, the switch shall have one contact of this overvoltage category for both the neutral conductor and the line conductor. For poly-phase generating units, it is required to have one contact of this overvoltage category for all active conductors. The second switch may be formed of electronic switching components from an inverter bridge or another circuit provided that the electronic switching components can be switched off by control signals and that it is ensured that a failure is detected and leads to prevention of the operation at the latest at the next reconnection. For PV-inverters without simple separation between the network and the PV generating unit (e.g. PV-Inverter without transformer) both switches mentioned in the paragraph above shall be switch-disconnectors with the requirements described therein, although one switching device is permitted to be located between PV array and PV inverter.",
